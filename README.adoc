This is a cluster manager implementation for Vert.x that uses http://ignite.apache.org/index.html[Apache Ignite].

Vert.x cluster manager is pluggable component. So you can replace default Vert.x cluster manager by this implementation.

Please see the main documentation on the web-site for a full description:
